# Reference Data API

Sourcelink is a conceptual business idea, used to create a series of tutorials 
on how to make use of JavaScript for full stack development. 

The code in the repository is primarily focused on utilizing [Strapi - Open Source Node.jS 
Headless CMS](https://strapi.io/) to develop an API to supply the Sourcelink Front End Applications both
Web and Mobile with reference data they need.
